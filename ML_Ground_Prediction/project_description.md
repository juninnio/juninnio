This project predicts ground stability and ground Texture using machine learning algorithms.

Technology used:
- Python3
- sci-kit learn (for data preprocessing and predictions)
- python pandas (for dataset manipulation)
- numpy 
- matplotlib (for visualization)

Machine learning algorithm used for numerical target prediction:
- Dummy model (for baseline scoring)
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression

Machine learning algorithm used for categorical target prediction:
- Dummy model
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

All algorithm are encapsulated withi pipelines which preprocess the data (encoding, scaling, and handling missing data).

Models are also evaluated using many different metrics.
