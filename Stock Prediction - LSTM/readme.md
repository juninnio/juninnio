Data consists of microsoft stock prices from 1986 to 2024. This project includes several technical analysis and data analysis of microsoft stock.
Using Open, high, and close prices as inputs to feed into Recurrent neural network with LSTM, a great result is achieved with the model predicting similar patterns and prices for the stocks.

This model is great for predicting overall patterns and trends, as the model is accurate enough but not quite to predict actual prices.
