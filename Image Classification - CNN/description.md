Image Classification project.
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which uses 2 convolutional layer and 2 polling layer, as well as flattening layer. 
This code works only for 2 classes, which outputs between 1 and 0, which in this case represents cats and dogs.

Unfortunately, the dataset can't be uploaded here as the size is too big, but please do send me a message if you need the dataset.

Libraries used:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- NumPy
